Some interesting charts from google chart.js
https://developers.google.com/chart/
The charts are based on pure HTML5/SVG technology 
(adopting VML for old IE versions), 
so no plugins are required. 
All of them are interactive, and many are pannable and zoomable.

Be careful, a new version of Google Charts was released on February 23, 2016 
and is the official current release.
The current version of Google Charts is the Version 45, September 12, 2016 release.
On July 28, 2015, we announced frozen versions. 
These are releases of Google Charts that will remain unchanged forever 
(modulo the occasional critical fix). At the moment we have these versions:
45, corresponding to our September 12, 2016 release.
44, corresponding to our February 23, 2016 release.

v45:
**The GeoChart and Map chart no longer require you to include the jsapi loader. 
There is a new mapsApiKey loader setting to let you specify your own key, 
rather than get the default behavior which may result in occassional throttling of service.**
There are some pb, see:
